# Agile Methodologies

DevOps, SRE; Agile. Many of the pieces in todays Roles and Practices can be
directly drawn from 17 Software Engineers in Snowbird, Utah.

## [The Goal](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
Uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others
do it.

## [Frameworks](https://developer.epa.gov/guide/templates-guides/agile/agile-frameworks/)
 Commonly implemented with [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)), however there are other popular frameworks which can be used within agile.
- Kanban
- Scrumban
- Extreme Programming (XP)

## [Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

Tying a similarity together, DevOps has a ["Shift Left"](https://devops.com/devops-shift-left-avoid-failure/) practice in which testing is adapted to a different interval, Agile also has a "left" concept. Though unrelated, we can see how things have progressed.

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

- Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

- Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

- Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

- Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

- The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

- Working software is the primary measure of progress.

- Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

- Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

- The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.
